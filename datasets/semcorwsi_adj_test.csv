"In free_burning electric arcs , for_instance , approximately 90 % of the total arc power is transferred to the anode giving_rise to local heat fluxes in excess of **f as measured by the authors - the exact value depending_on the arc atmosphere .",exact,5:00:00:correct:00,2,JJ,"(200, 205)"
In plasma generators the superimposed forced convection may modify the picture somewhat .,superimposed,5:00:00:added:00,0,JJ,"(25, 37)"
The heat transfer to the anode is_due to the following effects : 1 .,following,5:00:01:succeeding(a):00,1,JJ,"(45, 54)"
The pressure gradient producing the jet is_due to the nature of the magnetic_field in the arc ( rapid decrease of current density from cathode to the anode ) .,rapid,5:00:00:fast:01,1,JJ,"(96, 101)"

The cathode consisted_of a 1/4 '' diameter thoriated tungsten rod attached to a water_cooled copper tube .,water-cooled,5:00:00:cool:01,1,JJ,"(80, 92)"

In this design the anode holder is water_cooled and the heat losses by conduction from the anode were determined by measuring the temperature rise of the coolant .,water-cooled,5:00:00:cool:01,1,JJ,"(35, 47)"
Temperatures of the shield and of the surface of the water_cooled anode holder were measured by thermocouples to account_for heat received by the coolant but not originating from the anode plug .,water-cooled,5:00:00:cool:01,1,JJ,"(53, 65)"
The lower_limit was determined by the fact that for smaller flow_rates the arc started to strike to the anode holder instead of to the porous graphite plug and that it became highly unstable .,smaller,5:00:00:small:00,1,JJ,"(52, 59)"
The rest of the surface had a temperature which decreased towards the outer diameter of the plug .,outer,3:00:00::,1,JJ,"(70, 75)"
The mean temperature of the surface was then computed according to the following relation : **f where x is the fraction of the plug area covered by the hot spot .,following,5:00:01:succeeding(a):00,1,JJ,"(71, 80)"
This calculation results in an enthalpy rise which is somewhat high because it assumes a mass flow equally distributed over the plug cross_section whereas in_reality the mass velocity is expected to be smaller in the regions of higher temperatures .,smaller,5:00:00:small:00,1,JJ,"(202, 209)"
Simultaneously with the anode surface temperature and voltage measurements pyrometer readings were taken along the cylindrical surface of the carbon anode holder as indicated on figure 2 .,cylindrical,5:00:00:rounded:00,1,JJ,"(115, 126)"
The reflection of radiation originating from the anode holder and reflected back to it by the surrounding metal surfaces should also be small because of the specular characteristic of the metal surfaces and of the specific geometry .,surrounding,5:00:00:close:01,1,JJ,"(94, 105)"
The total heat loss through the anode holder included also the heat conducted through the base of the cylindrical piece into the adjacent metal parts .,cylindrical,5:00:00:rounded:00,1,JJ,"(102, 113)"
