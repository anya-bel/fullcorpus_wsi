"In the Analytical phase of their Cubism , Braque and Picasso had not_only had to minimize three-dimensionality simply in_order to preserve it ; they had also had to generalize it - to the point , finally , where the illusion of depth and relief became abstracted from specific three-dimensional entities and was rendered largely as the illusion of depth and relief as_such : as a disembodied attribute and expropriated property detached from everything not itself .",specific,3:00:00::,1,JJ,"(268, 276)"

"In this model , then , the industry is presumed to realize that they could successfully resist a change in the basic wage rate , but since such a change is the only effective means to raising prices they may , in circumstances to be spelled_out in Part 2 , below , find it to their advantage to allow the wage rise .",2,5:00:00:cardinal:00,1,JJ,"(253, 254)"

"Text lookup , as we will describe it , consists_of three steps .",lookup,1:22:00::,1,NN,"(5, 11)"
This initiates the second step of glossary lookup - connecting the information cell of forms in the text form list to dictionary forms .,lookup,1:22:00::,1,NN,"(43, 49)"
These two pieces of information for each dictionary form that is matched by a text form constitute the table of dictionary usage .,table,1:14:00::,1,NN,"(103, 108)"
"When a match is found , an entry is made in the table of dictionary usage .",table,1:14:00::,1,NN,"(48, 53)"
These two steps essentially complete the lookup operation .,lookup,1:22:00::,1,NN,"(41, 47)"
"The final step merely uses the table of dictionary usage to select the dictionary information that pertains to each form matched in the text form list , and uses the list of information cells recorded in text order to attach the appropriate information to each occurrence in text .",table,1:14:00::,1,NN,"(31, 36)"
The first stage of translation after glossary lookup is structural analysis of the input text .,lookup,1:22:00::,1,NN,"(46, 52)"
The grammatic descriptions of all forms in the dictionary are recorded in a separate part of the dictionary file .,part,1:09:00::,9,NN,"(85, 89)"
